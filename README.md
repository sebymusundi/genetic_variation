### Genetic variation

This script is used to analyze whole genome sequencing data to reveal different variations. I have used to script to analyze data related to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. 

The current script is written in Nextflow and encompasses a number of different tools. The variant callers used in this analysis are bcftools mpileup and lofreq.
